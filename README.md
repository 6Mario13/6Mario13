# Hi, Mariusz it's my name but you can also call me Mario ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I recently finished a 6 month UX/UI course at BIT - Beam Institute Of Technology in Berlin and now I'm discovering the world of **web development** and I want to become a **front-end developer**. Before I decided to change my career path I worked in the tech industry for a company that supports Microsoft. I'm also a former professional basketball player and worked as a Bartender for a few years.

## My Skills

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- **UX/UI Design Tools:** Figma
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Other Tools:** VSCode

## Current Projects ðŸš§

I'm currently working on two personal projects, which Iâ€™ll be sharing soon:
1. **RATRAD** â€“ A guide to help you choose the right type of bike for your needs.
2. **NINE TILES** â€“ A simple social application using backend elements with the ability to log in, add posts, comment and like them.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue working on these!

## What I'm Looking For

Iâ€™m eager to start my career as a **web front-end developer**. Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and collaborate with teams where I can grow further.

Feel free to connect with me or check out my work! âœ¨
